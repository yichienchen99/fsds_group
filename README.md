#### Project title: Limiting Spillover & Reviving Communities: Tighten the Rein of Airbnb-induced Gentrification in London

This repository is for group project of CASA0013: Foundations of Spatial Data Science 22/23, contributed by Eunyoung Choi, Keru Bai, Ruoping Lyu, Yi-Chien Chen. It contains both the analysis process (Reproducible analysis) and our evidence-based recommendations (Policy briefing). 

## Brief briefing

### Key findings:

* Airbnb listings have an extremely high concentration in central London and a high concentration in the Heathrow airport surrounding area. 

* Airbnb listings clustering form a clear three-ring structure in London.

* Over the period of 2016-2022, the number of low-occupancy and high-availability entire properties listings has increased and then decreased in central London (showing an overall decline), while there has been a significant increase in many outer London LSOAs, implying a spillover effect of tourism-related gentrification into outer London where locals may struggle to find affordable housing. 

* The higher the number of non-UK-born residents, the higher the number of Airbnb listings within the LSOA and the significantly higher the housing prices. Combining with the risk that foreign investment poses to the London housing market, homes under foreign investment are more likely to be left vacant for long periods of time and rented out as whole house listings in the context of Airbnb. 

* Tourism factors (namely transportation, Airbnb listing and hotel number) have strong relationships with the housing price, showing strong touristification happening in London and little chance to reverse. 


### Policy recommendations: 

* Use the non-clustering transition ring currently in mid-outer London to hold the Airbnb growth within inner London and beware of spillover of Airbnb-related gentrification into outer London affordable areas.
 
* Monitor and restrict short term rentals of homes owned by foreign investment.
 
* Detect Airbnb hotspots along the Underground line in zone 1 and revive local communities to become more efficient in both tourist needs and residential demands.
